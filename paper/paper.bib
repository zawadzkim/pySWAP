It describes a domain from the top of canopy into the groundwater which may be in interaction with a surface water system. The program has been developed by Wageningen Environmental Research and Wageningen University, and is designed to simulate transport processes at field scale and during entire growing seasons. This is a new release with recent developments on atmosphere, soil water and crop growth interactions. This manual describes the theoretical background, model use, input requirements and output tables.},

To serve the needs of diﬀerent types of users, like water authorities, provinces, drinking water companies and the National Department of Infrastructure and Water Management we developed a toolbox named WaterVision Agriculture as an instrument that can determine eﬀects on crop yield and the farm economy as a result of drought, too wet or too saline conditions for both current and future climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Time series analysis is an increasingly popular method to analyze heads measured in an observation well. Common applications include the quantification of the effect of different stresses (rainfall, pumping, etc.), and the detection of trends and outliers. Pastas is a new and open source Python package for the analysis of hydrogeological time series. The objective of Pastas is twofold: to provide a scientific framework to develop and test new methods, and to provide a reliable ready-to-use software tool for groundwater practitioners. Transfer function noise modeling is applied using predefined response functions. For example, the head response to rainfall is simulated through the convolution of measured rainfall with a Gamma response function. Pastas models are created and analyzed through scripts, ensuring reproducibility and providing a transparent report of the entire modeling process. A Pastas model can be constructed in seven simple steps: import Pastas, read the time series, create a model, specify the stresses and the types of response functions, estimate the model parameters, visualize output, and analyze the results. These seven steps, including the corresponding Python code, are applied to investigate how rainfall and reference evaporation can explain measured heads in an observation well in Kingstown, Rhode Island, USA. The second example demonstrates the use of scripts to analyze a large number of observation wells in batch to estimate the extent of the drawdown caused by a well field in the Netherlands.

abstract = {Abstract FloPy is a Python package for creating, running, and post-processing MODFLOW-based groundwater flow and transport models. FloPy functionality has expanded to support the latest version of MODFLOW (MODFLOW 6) including support for unstructured grids. FloPy can simplify the process required to download MODFLOW-based and other executables for Linux, MacOS, and Windows operating systems. Expanded FloPy capabilities include (1) full support for structured and unstructured spatial discretizations; (2) geoprocessing of spatial features and raster data to develop model input for supported discretization types; (3) the addition of functionality to provide direct access to simulated output data; (4) extension of plotting capabilities to unstructured MODFLOW 6 discretization types; and (5) the ability to export model data to shapefiles, NetCDF, and VTK formats for processing, analysis, and visualization by other software products. Examples of using expanded FloPy capabilities are presented for a hypothetical watershed. An unstructured groundwater flow and transport model, with several advanced stress packages, is presented to demonstrate how FloPy can be used to develop complicated unstructured model datasets from original source data (shapefiles and rasters), post-process model results, and plot simulated results.},
