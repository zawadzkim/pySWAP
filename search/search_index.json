Additionally, it integrates with external databases, such as KNMI for Dutch weather data and the WOFOST crop parameter database. The SWAP executables for Windows and Linux are included in this repo and no additional SWAP installation is needed.</p> <p>The model variables are based on the original input files from SWAP developers, the user manual (Kroes et al., 2017), and other documents available on the SWAP website.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>While pyswap already supports core SWAP functionalities, there's plenty of room for improvement.

The classes in this module represent distincs sections of the .crp file. The main class is the <code>CropFile</code> class which holds the settings for the crop simulation.</p> <p>SWAP has three modes for crop simulations which users define in the CROPROTATION _table in the .swp file:</p> <pre><code>* 1 - simple crop settings - use CropDevelopmentSettingsFixed\n* 2 - detailed, WOFOST general settings - use CropDevelopmentSettingsWOFOST\n* 3 - dynamic grass growth model - use CropDevelopmentSettingsGrass\n</code></pre> <p>For each choice, the .crp file will look different. Therefore, multiple classes  are defined in this module to deal with those different settings.</p> <p>Classes:</p> Name Description <code>CropFile</code> <p>Class for the .crp file.</p> <code>CropDevelopmentSettingsWOFOST</code> <p>Class for the crop development settings in WOFOST.</p> <code>CropDevelopmentSettingsFixed</code> <p>Class for the fixed crop development settings.</p> <code>CropDevelopmentSettingsGrass</code> <p>Class for the grass crop development settings.</p> <code>OxygenStress</code> <p>Class for the oxygen stress settings.</p> <code>DroughtStress</code> <p>Class for the drought stress settings.</p> <code>SaltStress</code> <p>Class for the salt stress settings.</p> <code>CompensateRWUStress</code> <p>Class for the compensate root water uptake stress settings.</p> <code>Interception</code> <p>Class for the interception settings.</p> <code>CO2Correction</code> <p>Class for the CO2 correction settings.</p> <code>ScheduledIrrigation</code> <p>Class for the scheduled irrigation settings.</p> <code>Preparation</code> <p>Class for the preparation settings.</p>"}, {"location": "reference/model-components/#pyswap.components.crop.AMAXTB", "title": "<code>AMAXTB</code>", "text": "<p>               Bases: <code>BaseTableModel</code></p> <p>maximum CO2 assimilation rate [0..100 kg/ha/hr, R] as function of development stage [0..2 -, R]</p> <p>Attributes:</p> Name Type Description <code>DVS</code> <code>Series[float]</code> <p>Development stage of the crop.</p> <code>AMAX</code> <code>Series[float]</code> <p>Maximum CO2 assimilation rate.</p> Source code in <code>pyswap/components/tables.py</code> <pre><code>class AMAXTB(BaseTableModel):\n    \"\"\"maximum CO2 assimilation rate [0..100 kg/ha/hr, R] as function of development stage [0..2 -, R]\n\n    Attributes:\n        DVS (Series[float]): Development stage of the crop.\n        AMAX (Series[float]): Maximum CO2 assimilation rate.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    DVS: Series[float] | None = pa.Field(**DVSRANGE)\n    DNR: Series[float] | None = pa.Field(**YEARRANGE)\n    AMAX: Series[float] = pa.Field(ge=0.0, le=100.0)\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "reference/model-components/#pyswap.components.crop.CFTB", "title": "<code>CFTB</code>", "text": "<p>               Bases: <code>BaseTableModel</code></p> <p>Crop factor [0..2 [-], R], as function of dev. stage [0..2 -, R]</p> <p>Attributes:</p> Name Type Description <code>DVS</code> <code>Series[float]</code> <p>Development stage of the crop.</p> <code>DNR</code> <code>Series[float]</code> <p>Day number.</p> <code>CF</code> <code>Series[float]</code> <p>Crop factor.</p> Source code in <code>pyswap/components/tables.py</code> <pre><code>class CFTB(BaseTableModel):\n    \"\"\"Crop factor [0..2 [-], R], as function of dev. stage [0..2 -, R]\n\n    Attributes:\n        DVS (Series[float]): Development stage of the crop.\n        DNR (Series[float]): Day number.\n        CF (Series[float]): Crop factor.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    DVS: Series[float] | None = pa.Field(**DVSRANGE)\n    DNR: Series[float] | None = pa.Field(**YEARRANGE)\n    CF: Series[float] | None\n</code></pre>"}, {"location": "reference/model-components/#pyswap.components.crop.CHTB", "title": "<code>CHTB</code>", "text": "<p>               Bases: <code>BaseTableModel</code></p> <p>Crop Height [0..1.d4 cm, R], as function of dev. stage [0..2 -, R]</p> <p>Attributes:</p> Name Type Description <code>DVS</code> <code>Series[float]</code> <p>Development stage of the crop.</p> <code>DNR</code> <code>Series[float]</code> <p>Day number.</p> <code>CH</code> <code>Series[float]</code> <p>Crop height.</p> Source code in <code>pyswap/components/tables.py</code> <pre><code>class CHTB(BaseTableModel):\n    \"\"\"Crop Height [0..1.d4 cm, R], as function of dev. stage [0..2 -, R]\n\n    Attributes:\n        DVS (Series[float]): Development stage of the crop.\n        DNR (Series[float]): Day number.\n        CH (Series[float]): Crop height.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    DVS: Series[float] | None = pa.Field(**DVSRANGE)\n    DNR: Series[float] | None = pa.Field(**YEARRANGE)\n    # # CF was added for compatibility with example grass files in original SWAP distribution\n    # # that are used for testing this package.

you do not need to (and actually cannot) adjust the paths at the beginning. This is because pySWAP runs SWAP in a temporary directory and handles paths automatically. The same goes for file names; the default and frozen file names are \"swap\" for inputs (e.g., drainage file) and \"result\" for output.    </p> <p>After adding the two sections, you can view how the section would look like as a SWAP-compatible string, or see the current shape of the .swp file by calling <code>ml.swp</code> property. You may notice more parameters that you wanted to set. It's because by default, heat flow (<code>HeatFlow</code>), solute transport (<code>SoluteTransport</code>) and fixed irrigation (<code>FixedIrrigation</code>) modules are turned off in the model. There are also default settings for some parameters of Richard's equation (<code>RichardsSettings</code>). To change it, it's enough to define your own objects with desired settings and reassign them in the <code>ml</code> instance.</p> In\u00a0[4]: Copied! <pre>print(ml.swp)\n</pre> print(ml.swp)

Each attribute has an assigned type and validation rules (e.g., lower and upper bounds). Many of these types are custom annotated types with specific serialization and validation rules. These rules tell the class constructor how to interpret a value when it's provided and how to format the data when it is saved to a file.</p> <p>Below are examples of types with their validation and serialization rules.
